# CRC check and GUI #

*Completed as a part of the Telecommunications course in Monash University*

***

This is a mini project where a [CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check#Computation) encoder and decoder was developed in a MATLAB environment. A MATLAB GUI is used here to interact with the user. Executing the GUI_CRC.m will execute the program. Ensure all other dependencies (GUI_CRC.fig, CRCGenerator.m and CRCVerifier.m) are in the same directory.



The program has two important features:
-   Given some information bit of any realistic length it can convert the information bits to CRC encoded bits.
-   It can check whether any encoded bits are properly encoded.

**Note: This program considers CRC-10 for encoding and decoding. Ensure any binary input to the program are separated by space.**
